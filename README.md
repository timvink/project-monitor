# Open source projects

A dashboard monitor of my open source projects: [https://timvink.github.io/project-monitor/](https://timvink.github.io/project-monitor/)

An excuse to play with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). Inspired by [mgedmin/project-summary](https://github.com/mgedmin/project-summary).
